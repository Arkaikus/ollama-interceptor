## Intro <a name="intro"></a>

This is a chrome extension that allows you to redirect traffic into your ollama local instance

Built for:
> Chrome does not accept manifest v2 extensions since Jan 2022, therefore this template uses manifest v3.

* Read more about Chrome manifest v2 support [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/).

## Features <a name="features"></a>
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Chrome Extension Manifest Version 3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)
- [Github Action](https://github.com/JohnBra/vite-web-extension/actions/workflows/ci.yml) to build and zip your extension (manual trigger)

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>
1. Clone this repositoryï½€
2. Change `name` and `description` in `manifest.json`
3. Run `yarn` or `npm i` (check your node version >= 16)
4. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
5. Load Extension in Chrome
   1. Open - Chrome browser
   2. Access - chrome://extensions
   3. Tick - Developer mode
   4. Find - Load unpacked extension
   5. Select - `dist` folder in this project (after dev or build)
6. If you want to build in production, Just run `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

### Customization
The template includes **all** of the Chrome extension pages. You will likely have to customize it to fit your needs.

E.g. you don't want the newtab page to activate whenever you open a new tab:
1. remove the directory `newtab` and its contents in `src/pages`
2. remove `chrome_url_overrides: { newtab: 'src/pages/newtab/index.html' },` in `manifest.json`

If you need to declare extra HTML pages beyond those the manifest accommodates, place them in the Vite config under build.rollupOptions.input.

This example includes a welcome page to open when the user installs the extension.

CSS files in the `src/pages/*` directories are not necessary. They are left in there in case you want 
to use it in combination with Tailwind CSS. **Feel free to delete them**.

Tailwind can be configured as usual in the `tailwind.config.cjs` file. See doc link below.

### Publish your extension
To upload an extension to the Chrome store you have to pack (zip) it and then upload it to your item in entry 
in the Chrome Web Store.

This repo includes a Github Action Workflow to create a 
[optimized prod build and create the zip file](https://github.com/JohnBra/vite-web-extension/actions/workflows/ci.yml).

To run the workflow do the following:
1. Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your forked repository from this template
2. In the left sidebar click on **"Build and Zip Extension"**
3. Click on **"Run Workflow"** and select the main branch, then **"Run Workflow"**
4. Refresh the page and click the most recent run
5. In the summary page **"Artifacts"** section click on the generated **"vite-web-extension"**
6. Upload this file to the Chrome Web Store as described [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/)

# Credit <a name="credit"></a>
Heavily inspired by [Jonghakseo's vite chrome extension boilerplate](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite). 
It uses SASS instead of TailwindCSS if you want to check it out.
